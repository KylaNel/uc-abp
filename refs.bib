	abstract = {The Dining Cryptographers Network (DCN) protocol is an anonymous communication system (ACS) that facilitates broadcast while providing complete unobservability to the participants. Notably, it is the only protocol from the ACS family to offer such guarantees. With the increasing demand for such properties due to repeated infringements on personal privacy, this protocol has attracted significant attention in recent years to attain a commercially viable solution. Despite this, the security guarantees have been structured in sub-optimal frameworks for communication systems such as simulation or game-based security due to their inability to retain said guarantees in a protocol composition, which is common for communication systems. We address the issue by proposing a provably secure DCN protocol in the universally composable (UC) setting. We start by presenting an ideal functionality that formalizes the desired security guarantees in the UC framework. We then construct a DCN protocol and prove it securely realizes said functionality.},

However, current modeling of security in the presence of such setup falls short of providing the expected security guarantees. A quintessential example of this phenomenon is the deniability concern: there exist natural protocols that meet the strongest known composable security notions, and are still vulnerable to bad interactions with rogue protocols that use the same setup.},

In a surprising result, Hirt and Zikas (Eurocrypt 2010) recently observed that all existing protocols for this task are insecure against an adaptive adversary who can choose which parties to corrupt as the protocol progresses. Moreover, they prove an impossibility result for adaptively secure broadcast in their setting. We argue that the communication model adopted by Hirt and Zikas is unrealistically pessimistic. We revisit the problem of adaptively secure broadcast in a more natural synchronous model (with rushing), and show that broadcast is possible in this setting for an arbitrary number of corruptions. Our positive result holds under a strong, simulationbased deﬁnition in the universal-composability framework.},

	abstract = {Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (ZK-PoK) for discrete logarithms and related problems are indispensable for practical cryptographic protocols. Recently, Camenisch, Kiayias, and Yung provided a speciﬁcation language (the CKY-language) for such protocols which allows for a modular design and protocol analysis: for every zero-knowledge proof speciﬁed in this language, protocol designers are ensured that there exists an eﬃcient protocol which indeed proves the speciﬁed statement. However, the protocols resulting from their compilation techniques only satisfy the classical notion of ZK-PoK, which is not retained are when they used as building blocks for higher-level applications or composed with other protocols. This problem can be tackled by moving to the Universal Composability (UC) framework, which guarantees retention of security when composing protocols in arbitrary ways. While there exist generic transformations from Σ-protocols to UC-secure protocols, these transformation are often too ineﬃcient for practice.},

As tools for obtaining this, we make three contributions of independent interest: we construct the ﬁrst (binary) linear time encodable codes with non-trivial distance and rate approaching 1, we construct the ﬁrst almost universal hash function with small seed that can be computed in linear time, and we introduce a new primitive called interactive proximity testing that can be used to verify whether a string is close to a given linear code.},
